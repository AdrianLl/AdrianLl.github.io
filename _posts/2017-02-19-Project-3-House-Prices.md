# Predicting House Prices Using Linear regression

## Main Problem and Objectives

 * Build a prediction model for house pricing in Ames, IA
 * Where are most sales taking place?
 * Where are the most expensive houses located?
 * Discuss Possible Improvements

## Describing the Data and Limitations
* Target Prediction Feature: Sale Price
* Number of Instances: 1460
* Number of Attributes Allowed: 18
* Years of data collected: 2006 - 2010
* Missing

## Limitations
* The attributes provided are not necessarily the best indicators of the house pricing
* The data collected is mostly around a particular unstable time in the market

## Understanding the Data
**Looking at Correlations**

## Where are the most sales happening?

* Most Sales Happening in :
    * North Ames
* How many happened?
    * 225 (About 15.41 % of total sales)

## Creating a Regression model
* Type of Regression: Linear
* Attributes Dropped: Utilities
* Dummy Variable Selection: All except Lot Area and GrLivArea
    * Accuracy Testing:
    * R Squared = 0.899
    * Mean Absolute Error: 16261.24
    * Mean Squared Error: 637850318.41
    * Root Mean Squared Error: 25255.70
    * Cross Validation Score: 0.738
* Limitations of the Model

There were a lot of outliers in the data that have caused the RMSE and MSE to be quite high
The cross validation score was lower than the initial model made, although R Square was improved this could be a sign of some over fitting on this model.

## Possible Improvements
* More location based metrics such as surrounding businessâ€™, schools, police stations, etc

* More insight into the overall condition and quality metric

* More data points for expensive homes, to improve predictions on the expensive homes.
